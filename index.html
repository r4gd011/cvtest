        <p>
          I am a former US Army Sniper, specializing in long range target interdiction and covert surveillance, a US government high threat protection specialist. I am currently working as a Cyber Security and Threat Hunting Specialist on a SOC Team and I run my own company that specializes in Opponent Research (Oppo). I have taken part in operations
          involving
          some of our country's most high value targets, protected some of our most important principals and assets and conducted both blue team and purple team work in the cybersecurity realm. I am currently learning web development, both as a way
          to
          become a better red teamer and as a potential revenue stream.</p>
